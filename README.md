# search_engine

In the context of this project, I undertook the development of a search engine dedicated to the theme of the 2024 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN). The main objective of this initiative was to create an efficient tool for navigating and quickly accessing relevant information related to this major sporting event. To achieve this goal, we integrated the Spacy library, known for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, in order to implement precise and high-performing indexing.
